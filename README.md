spasntck
========

A [pants](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants) plugin which makes use of [spack](https://github.com/spack/spack) [*environments*](https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_environments.html) to separate installs of incompatible software. This separation happens to be something pants is quite good at caching.

I think the use cases of pants and spack are completely orthogonal to each other and this is a way to demonstrate that.

*spasntck* happens to sound like "spasm" and "tic", two things which I am very good at.
